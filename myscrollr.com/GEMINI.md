## Development Conventions

### Code Style

- The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code linting and formatting.
- The ESLint configuration is based on `@tanstack/eslint-config`.
- Run `npm run check` to format and lint the code.

### Git Commits

- The project does not have a formal commit message convention, but the commit history shows a preference for short, descriptive messages.

### Routing

- The project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) for file-based navigation.
- The routes are defined in the `src/routes` directory.
- The root layout is defined in `src/routes/__root.tsx`.
- The router tree is generated into `src/routeTree.gen.ts`. Do not edit this file manually.

### Styling

- The project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- Custom styles and design tokens are in `src/styles.css`.
- The project also uses `lucide-react` for icons.

## Testing

- The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing.
- Unit tests are located in the same directory as the files they are testing, with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- To run the tests, use the following command:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
